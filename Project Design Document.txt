Project Scoping
1 - Get a basic workflow running by breaking up the spritesheet into pngs and combining a series of pngs into a final spritesheet.





Ideal Final Workflow
1 - Import existing spritesheet from Noita as a series of .ases with a .json containing all necessary metadata
2 - Open files in Aseprite, edit, and save
3 - Export new .ase compilation as a Noita spritesheet
